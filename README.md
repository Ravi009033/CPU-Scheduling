CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulation

Overview

This Java project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms, providing a platform to analyze and compare their performance. The implemented algorithms include:

First-ComeFirst-Served (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF)

Priority Scheduling

Round Robin (RR)

Multilevel Queue Scheduling
